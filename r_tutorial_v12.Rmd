## R & RStudio tour [W1 D1]

A hands-on tutorial introducing the **R** , **RStudio** interface and basic **R commands** or operations. 

📌 **Important note**: After you have installed R and RStudio, you are ready to begin this chapter! So install them if you have not have them in your PC or laptop.

### 1. R 
If you type 'R' in the search 🔍 box, you may see 'R.4.4...' or something like that. if you click 🖱 on it opens 'RGui' (R graphical user interface) which has the R console window as like as bellow:

<a href="https://forum.posit.co/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/0/70baebfb866ed17833d04329045765c1d7232190_2_1380x730.jpeg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://forum.posit.co/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/0/70baebfb866ed17833d04329045765c1d7232190_2_1380x730.jpeg" width="500" style="border-radius:8px;">
</a>

[What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

But we will not use it as RStudio app already has it as built-in. So just search  🔍 RStudio and open RStudio.   

💡*Do this chapter in RStudio to maximize your understanding*💡

RStudio is an 'integrated development environment (IDE)' designed to help you be more productive in your daily data science work.

📌After you have installed R and RStudio, you are ready to begin this section!

When you start RStudio, you’ll see four key regions or “panes” in the interface: the 'Source pane', the 'Console pane', the 'Environment pane' and the 'Output Pane'.

### 2. 🖥 The Four Panes of RStudio💻 


<a href="https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/rstudio-panes-labeled.jpeg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/rstudio-panes-labeled.jpeg" width="500" style="border-radius:8px;">
</a>

- **Source Pane**: Top-left, used for writing and editing scripts. 
- **Console Pane**: Bottom-left, where you run R commands interactively. 
- **Environment/History Pane**: Top-right, displays loaded variables and command history. 
- **Output/Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer Pane**: Bottom-right, for file browsing, plots, installed packages, help pages, and web content.

> 💡 🧭 Explore the interface of RStudio and try hovering over each pane to see what they contain.

### 3. 📂 Get or Set a Working Directory
#### Get Working Directory
If you want to know where are you in your R or Rstudio or in this instance
or what is your current working directory, `getwd()` function helps you to find that:

use `getwd()` function to *g*et your current *w*orking *d*irectory printed

```{r getwd, exercise=TRUE}
getwd()
```
`getwd()` returns an absolute 'file path' or 'folder path' or 'directory path' representing the current working directory of the R process

#### Set Working Directory
It's a good idea to *set* your *w*orking *d*irectory where your R project files are stored.
Use `setwd()` function (a default built-in function)

`setwd(dir)` is used to set the working directory to *dir* folder.
```{r setwd, exercise=TRUE}
# Set your working directory (modify the following path to your own)
setwd("dir")
```

It says `cannot change working directory`. 
⚠️ error ⚠️ That means it is a tutorial instance, you cant change `wd` here by executing single command but by multiple commands in a R code block (see bellow). You can when you open your RStudio in PC. But no worries we can continue rest.

📌 We use `setwd(dir)` to move from folder to folder based on our need.

---

### 4. 📝 Create a New R Project 📄 

Creating a project in RStudio helps to organize your work. Create a new R project via the menu:

**File > New Project > New Directory > New Project**

> ⚠️📝 This step is performed via the RStudio interface, not in this instance.

---

### 5. 📂 Create and Move into a Folder 📂

step 1: Let's create a 'new_folder' 📂 by `dir.create()`. 
step 2: use `setwd()` to change location to the 'new_folder'. 
step 3: use `getwd()` to print entire 'file path' to see if we moved to the 'new_folder'

```{r create-folder, exercise=TRUE}
dir.create("new_folder") # Create a folder

setwd("new_folder")      # Set new_folder as your working directory

getwd()                  # print path to see if you have moved to new_folder
```
📌 yes we see the folder path & 'new_folder' is printed at the end

📌 We create folder 📂 to organize our files.

📌 `getwd` returns an absolute 'file path' representing the current working directory

### 6. 📦 Install the `tidyverse` Package📦 in RStudio**
(not in this tutorial)
📌 `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages📦📦📦 for data science. We used some `tidyverse` packages in the **entire tutorial**.

```{r install-tidyverse, exercise=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse")   # remove first 👉 # to run in your rstudio
```
How to install tidyverse 📦 ?

⚠️📌 do not run `install.packages("tidyverse")` when you are in this tutorial's instance, please do **install only when you are in your RStudio**. 
**To install tidyverse📦 in RStudio**: remove first '#' to rerun in your rstudio and run

> ⚠️ Installing packages should typically be done only once per system. This line is not evaluated automatically in the tutorial to avoid repeated installations.

### 7. 📦 Load the `tidyverse` package 

Once installed, you can load it with `library()`.

```{r load-tidyverse, exercise=TRUE}
# Load tidyverse into your R session
library(tidyverse)   # attach the package
```

⚠️📌 if you get error message here (`there is no package called 'tidyverse'`) that means you have not installed `tidyverse` 📦 yet. it is OK, no need to install for this instance.**You should not install** while you are doing this tutorial series.

---

### 8. 📜 Start, Manage, and Save a **R Script**

To create and manage a R script go to (click on):

- **File > New File > R Script**
- Save 💾 the script using **File > Save As**.

Name the file📝 `example_script.R`.

> ✍️ Once you've created the script, try copying and pasting the following content into it:
```r
print("Hello, RStudio!")
```

---

### 9. 📜 Execute an **R Script**

Create an example R script, e.g. 'example_script'
Write some in the script
Run scripts using `source()`.

```{r run-script, exercise=TRUE}
# Save a script and run it
example_script <- 'print("Hello, RStudio!")' # assign texts to an object
writeLines(example_script, "example_script.R") # write it in the script
source("example_script.R") # execute the script
```
🎉 Hurrah!🎉 You have just successfully run a **R script**! 🙌

#### explanation (📝 What this above 'R chunk' does): 

* 2nd line stores the text `print("Hello, RStudio!")` as an R object named `example_script`.
* 3rd line writes 📝 the contents of `example_script` into a file named `example_script.R`. 
* 4th line executes▶️ the script using `source()`, which runs the code inside the file and prints the message. 

---

### 10. 🔍 'Help' in RStudio ❓

There are multiple ways to get help in R:

⚠️ Following R block will open two *new browser windows*, but you can return back to the tutorial ⬅️ 
```{r help-mean, exercise=TRUE}
# Help using the help() function
help(mean)

# Or using the question mark shortcut
?mean # results pops up in a new window (return when you are done)
```

> 💡Tips: You can also press **F1** button while in RStudio while your cursor is on a function name to view its documentation in RStudio.

### Well done! 🎉

You've completed the introduction to RStudio and basic R commands! 🎉
You're off to a great start!

Next chapter ⤵️

## Variables and Operators [W1 D2]
### Variables, Variable's types & Operators
In this chapter, you will learn about various `elements` of a programming language and see how they are realized in `R`.


Let's start!

### 1. Variable (object)

A *variable* is a `name` to which we assign information that stores `data`.

Calculate sum of the following values (add one value with another)
```{r cal, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 1}
6 + 4
```

We can do this calculation differently by using `assignment operator` `<-`

### Operator
In R, an operator is a symbol or function that performs an operation on one or more values (called operands). Operators are essential for performing calculations, comparisons, logical tests, and more. 

💡Tip: For detail see [all types operators](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_operators.asp)

#### Use of *assignment operator*
example: 
```{r assign-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
a <- 6

a
```
Here `a` is a `variable` or an `object` and is saved in R 

More practice:
```{r assign-2, exercise=TRUE}
b <- 4

b
```
Here `b` is an `object` too. 


Now you can sum them
```{r cal-vector, exercise=TRUE}
a <- 6
b <- 4
a + b
```

you can even `assign` this calculation to a `new` object from this 
```{r assign_again, exercise=TRUE}
a <- 6
b <- 4

c <- a + b
c
```

We are not limited to numbers; we can assign `characters` too:

```{r assign_text, exercise=TRUE}
text1 <- 'r'
text1
```
📌 **Note**: You realized that `' '` or `""` is used around the 'texts' for all kind of `character` assignment in R

another example:
```{r assign_text_num, exercise=TRUE}
text2 <- 't20'
text2
```

There are `three` equivalent `ways of assigning` in R, so you can choose any one

way 1

```{r assignment_style1, exercise=TRUE}
val <- 3
val
```

way 2

```{r assignment_style2, exercise=TRUE}
val = 3
val
```

way 3

```{r assignment_style3, exercise=TRUE}
3 -> val
val
```

📌 Note: It is best to use `<-` for assignments to avoid confusion. Use `=` only for function arguments like `f(a = 3)`.


###  2. Variable Naming

Syntactically valid names consist of letters, numbers, dots or underscores, and must start with a letter or a dot not followed by a number. *Reserved words cannot be used as variable names*.

❗ Reserved words include:

* `if`, `else`, `repeat`, `while`, `function`, `for`, `in`, `next`, `break`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`, `Inf`, `NaN`, `NA`, etc. 

* Cannot use: `c`, `q`, `t`, `C`, `D`, `I` 
* Should not use: `T`, `F`. 

💡Naming tips:

* Make names informative. 
* Use consistent notation: camelCase, dot.notation, or dash_notation. 
* Avoid very long names. 
* Avoid variable names like `my.variable.2`; prefer `my.variable2`.

### 3. Variable Types

Variables can be of several types:

* **Numeric (e.g. 2, 4.19) **
* **Integer (e.g. 2)** 
* **Character (e.g. karim)** 
* **Logical (TRUE/FALSE/NA)** 
* **Complex (e.g. 5 + 2p)** 

```{r assign_num_decimal, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 41.99
typeof(x)
```
🔹 What is a Double in R? 

- A 'double' is a type of `numeric` vector that can store 'decimal' values. 

- It is the default numeric type in R when you create numbers with decimals. 

```{r assign_a_range, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 1:3
x
```

How to check how thing are recognized
```{r assign_a_range_check_structure, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 1:3
x

class(x)
typeof(x)
mode(x)
storage.mode(x)
```

In R, the term **numeric** is a general data type that includes both:

- **double** (floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, 42) and 
- **integer** (whole numbers, e.g., 5L)


### 4. Changing variable types (casting):

```{r assign_integer_check, exercise=TRUE}
y = 12
class(y)
typeof(y)
```

🔹 What is numeric in R? 

- numeric is the default mode for numbers in R. 
- When you create a number like x <- 5, R stores it as a double, but it is still considered numeric.


```{r convert_to_integer_check, exercise=TRUE}
y = 12

z <- as.integer(y)
class(z)
typeof(z)

# call a `logical` variable as output
is.integer(z) 
```
📌 **Note**: anything starts with `#` is a `comment` in  R, it is not `code` or `command` anymore

More on casting:

```{r pi, exercise=TRUE}
pi <- 3.1415926536
pi

as.integer(pi)  # transform to integer

pi <- as.double(pi)   # transform to double
```


```{r pi2, exercise=TRUE}
as.integer(3.14)
as.integer(3.51) # its always make a round figure
```

```{r pi_check, exercise=TRUE}
round(3.51, digits = 1) # make a round figure as we learned in school
```

Coercion examples:
```{r Coercion, exercise=TRUE}
as.numeric('4.5678')
as.double('4.5678')
as.numeric('R course is cool!')
```

`as.numeric('R course is cool!')` code block returned 'NA' because R can not turn a 'text' into a 'numeric' value, if you do it becomes something unknown means 'NA'.


*Complex numbers:*
```{r complex, exercise=TRUE}
c = 7 + 4i
c
class(c)
typeof(c)
is.complex(c)
```

Logical type:

```{r Logical_type1, exercise=TRUE}
e <- 7 > 2
e
```


```{r  Logical_type2, exercise=TRUE}
f <- 2 >= 7
f
```


```{r Logical_type_check1, exercise=TRUE}
e <- 7 > 2
e

class(e)
typeof(e)
```


```{r  Logical_type_check2, exercise=TRUE}
d <- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA)
d
```

assign names as charecter
```{r  Logical_type_check3, exercise=TRUE}
names(d) <- as.character(d)
d
```

```{r  logical_1, exercise=TRUE}
g <- TRUE
g
```


```{r  logical_2, exercise=TRUE}
g <- T
g

is.logical(g)
typeof(g)
```

Lets get mad!

```{r  logical_3, exercise=TRUE}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
x + y
2 * x
x * y
```

So, Avoid using T or F as `variable names`:

```{r  avoid, exercise=TRUE}
F <- T
T
F
```
Now you see `false became true!`


Character type:

```{r  chr, exercise=TRUE}
character <- 'c'
character

text <- 'This is my first sentence in R.'
text

class(text)
typeof(text)
```

Treat `number` as `character` 
```{r  chr_to_num, exercise=TRUE}
number1 <- 3.14                       # assign a number (3.14) to a variable
number1.text <- as.character(number1)  # turn it into character

number1.text                          # print

class(number1.text)                   # check class of the variable
```
see, `"` is appeared around the number

Now, treat `character` as `number`
```{r chr_to_num2, exercise=TRUE}
number2.text <- "3.14"                 # assign a number (3.14) as a character variable with "" 

# now turn it into number
number2 <- as.numeric(number2.text)     # turn it into number
number2                                # print
class(number2)                          # check class of the variable
```
See, no `"` around the number


### 5. Strings
"String" is the content (e.g., "data", "This is R").
"Character" is the data type that holds strings.


Basic string operations:
```{r  text1, exercise=TRUE}
text1 <- "Bangladesh is a "
text2 <- "develpoing country"
```

add texts together
```{r  text2, exercise=TRUE}
text1 <- "Bangladesh is a "
text2 <- "develpoing country"


result <- paste(text1, text2, ".", sep='') # add texts
result                                     # print new string
```

call sub string or specific 'alphabet' or  'letter' 
```{r  sub_string, exercise=TRUE}
text1 <- "Bangladesh is a "
text2 <- "develpoing country"
result <- paste(text1, text2, ".", sep='') # add texts

sub("super eight", "semi final", result)
substr(result, start = 1, stop = 5)
```

Printing with `sprintf`:

```{r print, exercise=TRUE}
txt <- "blue"
val <- 345.78

sprintf("The weight of a %s ball is  %f g", txt, val)

text1 <- "Bangladesh"
text2 <- "darkgreen"
text3 <- "red"
sprintf("The flag of %s is made of %s and %s ", text1, text2, text3)
```

### ✅ Summary

- Variables are names or objects.
- To assign variables we use operators.
- Variables can be of types: numeric, logical, complex, character.
- Numeric includes: integer, double, floats.
- strings are texts within "". 
Thanks for listening, Now its your turn!


### Breakout room session (do **exercises** yourself or as a group)
Do following **exercises**

### Exercises 
#### Exercise 1. Create variables `var1` and `var2` and initialize them with two integers of choice and print the variables


📌 **Tips**: 

<a href="https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/learnr-for-remote/hint.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/learnr-for-remote/hint.png" width="500" style="border-radius:8px;">
</a>

📌 We have given some hints⬇️ under the `💡Hints` box, 
you can 🖱️`click` on `💡Hints`(only if you need help) and read the solution and copy them if you wish.

```{r ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```


```{r ex1-hint-1}
var1 <- 8

var1 # this will print what is saved in 'var1' 

# or use `print` command
print(var1)  # show what is saved under var1
```

```{r ex1-solution}
var1 <- 8

var1

var2 <- 369

var2
```

#### Exercise 2. Sum the two variables (use `'+'` operator) and save them as a new variable named `var3` and print the result.

```{r ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r ex2-hint-1}
var1 <- 8
var2 <- 369

var1 + var2  # addition
```

```{r ex2-hint-2}
var1 <- 8
var2 <- 369

var3 <- var1 + var2  # assign addition to a new variable

var3
```

#### Exercise 3. Check the `class`, `mode`, and `type` for *var1*, *var2*, *var3*.

```{r ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r ex3-hint-1}
class()
mode()
typeof()
```

```{r ex3-hint-2}
var1 <- 8
var2 <- 369
var3 <- var1 + var2  # assign addition to a new variable

class(var1)
mode(var1)
typeof(var1)
```


```{r ex3-hint-3}
var1 <- 8
var2 <- 369
var3 <- var1 + var2  # assign addition to a new variable

class(var1)
mode(var1)
typeof(var1)

class(var2)
mode(var2)
type(var2)

class(var3)
mode(var3)
typeof(var3)
```


#### Exercise 4. Create two character variables containing a text of choice. Check the `class`, `mode` and `type` of the first one.

```{r ex4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r ex4-hint-1}
var1_chr <- "tutorial"

var2_chr <- "like this tutorial"

```

```{r ex4-hint-2}
class()
mode()
typeof()
```


```{r ex4-hint-3}
class(var1_chr)
mode(var1_chr)
typeof(var_chr1)
```


#### Exercise 5. Sum `var1` to it. What is the result and why?


```{r ex5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r ex5-hint-1}
var1_chr <- "tutorial"
var1 <- 8

var1_chr + var1

```
It says: `Error in var1_chr + var1 : non-numeric argument to binary operator`
Reason: we tried to sum a character to a number which is not possible in reality.

#### Exercise 6. Convert `var3` to an integer, cast an integer variable to double, cast a string to a double.

```{r ex6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r ex6-hint-1}
var3 <- 25.67
```


```{r ex6-hint-2}
# Convert var3 to integer
var3 <- 25.67
int_var3 <- as.integer(var3)
```


```{r ex6-hint-3}
# Cast an integer to double
int_value <- 10
double_value <- as.double(int_value)
```


```{r ex6-hint-4}
# Cast a string to double
str_val <- "12.345"
numeric_val <- as.numeric(str_val)
```


```{r ex6-hint-5}
var3 <- 25.67

# Convert var3 to integer
int_var3 <- as.integer(var3)

# Cast an integer to double
int_value <- 10
double_value <- as.double(int_value)

# Cast a string to double

#### Exercise 7. Create two character variables containing two verses of your favorite song.
   - Concatenate the two variables.
   - Paste the variables with `'*'` as separator.
   - Find if `and` occurs in the second line.
   - Substitute a word for another.
   - Extract sub-string starting at the 5th character and 5 characters long.

### ✅ Summary

You've learn different elements of R programming such as `variable`, `operator`; and how to assign variables, their `types`, and how to `change types`. When you are ready, go on to the next tutorial to learn `Complex Data Structures`.

Next chapter ⤵️


## Vectors [W1 D2]
`Vector` is Basic data structure. Using the previously discussed basic data types
(`numeric`, `integer`, `logical` and `character`) one can construct more complex data structures.

### 1. Atomic Vectors

An *atomic vector*, or simply a **vector** is a one dimensional data structure (a collection) of elements of the same data type.
Elements of a vector are officially called *components*,
but we will just call them *elements*.

We construct vectors using core function `c()` (c means construct).
`c()` means Combine Values into a Vector or List

```{r vector_elements, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(1,2,5,7,9,27,45.5)
vec
```

### 2. Combining Vectors

```{r combine, exercise=TRUE}
# lets create some vector first
v1 <- c(1,3,5,7.56)
v1

v2 <- c('a','b','c')
v2

v3 <- c(0.1, 0.2, 3.1415)
v3

# combine vectors
v_all <- c(v1, v2, v3)
v_all
```

###  3. Basic Vector Arithmetics

```{r arithmatic, exercise=TRUE}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(7, -9, 15.2, 4)

# use like as calculator
v1 + v2
v1 - v2
v1 * v2
v1 / v2
```

###  4. Vector Indexing or positioning
call by Position
```{r index1, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
vec

# who is in these positions: 1 & 5
vec[1]
vec[5]

# call vector except specific position, to do that we use '-'
vec[-1]
vec[-2]
```
####  4.1. Vector Indexing Continued

```{r index2, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
vec.ind <- c(1,3,5)
vec[vec.ind] # calling by some position

# use logical type
vec.ind <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
vec[vec.ind]
```

#### 4.2. Named Indexing
assign names
```{r index3, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(23.7, 54.5, 22.7)
names(vec) <- c('sample1', 'sample2', 'sample3') # assign names
vec
vec[c('sample2', 'sample1')] # call by names
```

### 5. Removing Elements

```{r rm, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
vec[-5]
vec[-(c(1,3,5))]
```

### 6. Conditional Indexing

```{r con, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
vec < 3
vec[vec < 3]
```

### 7. Reverse Vector

```{r rev, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
rev(vec) # 
```

### 8. Vector Size
Length of an Object
```{r size, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(1:50)
vec

length(vec) # Length of an Object
```

### 9. Substitute Elements

replace
```{r subs, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(1:6)
vec[3] <- 'a'
vec

```

### 10. Round Values

```{r round, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(2.86653, 7.286524, 9.562432) 
round(vec, digits=3)
```

### 11. Sorting

```{r sort, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c(1:5, NA, NA, 1:3)
vec

sort(vec) # sorten

sort(vec, na.last = TRUE) # send NA at the end of the list

sort(vec, decreasing = TRUE) # decrease
```

### 12. Functions on Vector
Function is a `block of codes` that does specific `task` in R , e.g. function `max()` can calculate `maximum value` out of a vector or data. 
📌 **Note**: We will discuss 'function' in detail on in chapter: **Control structures & function**. 
Some useful default functions we
```{r func-1, exercise=TRUE}
v1 <- c(5,8,7,18,28)
max(v1)     # highest value
min(v1)     # lowest value 
sum(v1)     # total values
```

`max()`, `min()`, and `sum()` are some 'built-in functions' in R.

more 'arithmetic' functions:
```{r func-1p2, exercise=TRUE}
v1 <- c(5,8,7,18,28)
prod(v1)    # product of all the values

diff(v1)    # Lagged Differences (8-5, 7-8, 18 -7, 28 - 18)
cumsum(v1)  # cumulative total (5, 5 + 8, 13 + 7, 20 + 18 , 38 +2 8)
prod(v1)    # product of all the values (5×8×7×18×28)
```


### 13. Factors (factorization)
We can force R to make a new category by the `factor()` function
```{r factor1, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c('giraffe', 'donkey', 'liger', 'liger', 'giraffe', 'liger')
vec

vec.f <- factor(vec) # encode a vector as a factor 
vec.f

summary(vec.f)

as.numeric(vec.f)
```

#### 13.1 Custom Labels for Factors
If you like R to read as you wish, the you can give a names or numbers as `labels`
```{r factor2, exercise=TRUE}
vec.f <- factor(vec, levels=c('donkey', 'giraffe', 'liger'), 
                labels=c('zonkey','Sophie','tigon'))
vec.f

summary(vec.f)
```

#### 13.2 Ordered Factors

```{r factor3, exercise=TRUE}
vec <- c('tiny', 'small', 'medium', 'large')

factor(vec)
factor(vec, ordered=T) # order the list
```


### 🧠 Exercises
#### Exercise 8: Create and Modify Vectors

Create two vectors `p` and `q`, 
then perform operations like `addition`, and 
`multiply` with `2`, 
perform `length` checking, and 
calculate `mean` of the vector at the end.


```{r exe1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe1-hint-1, hint=TRUE}
"Hint 1: Use `c()` to create a vector."
```

```{r exe1-hint-2, hint=TRUE}
"Hint 2: Try using `sum()`, `mean()`, 
or `length()` to analyze the vector."
```

```{r exe1-solution, echo=TRUE}
# Create two vectors
p <- c(3, 6, 9)
q <- c(6, 8, 15)

# Explore length and element-wise operations
length(p)
length(p + q)

sum(p)
sum(q * q)
p + q

# Multiply and calculate mean
r <- p * 2
r
length(r)

r.mean <- mean(r)
length(r.mean)
```


#### Exercise 9: Working with Factors

Convert a character vector into a factor with custom labels.

```{r exe2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe2-hint, hint=TRUE} 
"Use the `factor()` function and 
the `labels` argument to rename factor levels."

```

```{r exe2-solution, echo=TRUE}
# make a vector
fact1 <- c('Liton', 'Shommoy', 'Sahanto', 'Sakib', 'Taskin', 'Tanzim')

# factor and label
factor(fact1, labels = c('Alpha', 'Beta', 'Gamma', 'Delta', 'Epsilon', 'Zeta'))
```


#### Exercise 10: Logical Indexing

Filter out elements from a vector using a logical condition.


```{r exe3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe3-hint}
"Use logical conditions like `x > 5` inside square brackets."

```

```{r exe3-solution}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)

x[x > 5] # keep anything greater than 5


# Or
x[3:6]  # ':' is an argument , it is to indicate range


```

#### Exercise 11: Sorting and NA Handling

Sort a vector containing `NA` values and control the position of `NA`s in the output.

```{r exe4, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe4-hint}
"Try setting `na.last = TRUE` and `na.last = FALSE` inside the `sort()` function."

```

```{r exe4_solution}
y <- c(3, 7, NA, 1, 9, NA, 5)

sort(y, na.last = TRUE)

sort(y, na.last = FALSE) # bring to the first
```
#### Exercise 12: Ordered Factors

Create and analyze an ordered factor.

```{r exe5, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe5-hint}
"Use the `ordered = TRUE` argument to make it an ordered factor."

```

```{r exe5-solution}
sizes <- c("small", "large", "medium", "small", "large")

ordered_sizes <- factor(sizes, levels = c("small", "medium", "large"), ordered = TRUE)

ordered_sizes

summary(ordered_sizes) 
```

#### Exercise 13: Vector Mathematics

Do arithmetic and statistical operations on two vectors `a` and `b`.
You may use `+` and `*` and calculate `average` & `standard deviation` 
```{r exe6, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe6-hint}
# Use `*` for element-wise multiplication, and explore `mean()` and `sd()` for statistics.

```


```{r exe6-solution}
a <- c(2, 4, 6)
b <- c(1, 3, 5)
a + b  # addition
mean(a * b) # average

Insert a value into a specific position in a vector and change an element.

```{r exe7, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe7-hint}
# Use `append()` to insert elements and indexing (e.g., `z[1] <- 10`) to modify.

```


```{r exe7-solution}
z <- c(1, 2, 4, 5)

Put several techniques together: remove `NA`s, calculate means, and summarize a factor.

```{r exe10, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exe10-hint}
# Use `na.omit()` to remove `NA`s and `summary(factor(...))` for factor counts.
```
```{r exe10-solution}

### Congratulations 🎉
### ✅ Summary

You've learn `vector` data structure of R programming, combining vectors, how to `index` elements, their `removal` or `substitution`, and how to `factorize`. 

Next chapter ⤵️


## Data types & structures [W1 D3]
### Previous overview
You have learned basic data `types`. Common atomic data `types` in R are: 

* **Numeric** – numbers with or without decimals (e.g., 3.14, 42) 
* **Integer** – whole numbers (e.g., 5L, where L denotes an integer)
* **Character** – text strings (e.g., "hello") 
* **Logical** – boolean values (TRUE, FALSE) 
* **Complex** – complex numbers (e.g., 1+2i)  

**Now you will learn data `structures`, more specifically:** 

* **data structures in R** & *example* of each data structure 
* **exploring data** in R and
* Handling **missing data (NA)**

### 1. Data `structures` 
Some important data structures:  

* Vector
* List
* Data frame
* matrice
* Array
* Factor
* Tibble

</a>

[Data structures **at a glance**](https://github.com/abu85/datasets/blob/main/R_data_structures_ver_1_1.png?raw=true)



#### `Vector` data structure

Vector (ordered collection of same data type)
```{r str-1, exercise=TRUE}
X <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8)

# Printing those elements in console
print(X)
```


#### `List` data structure 

List: 
The first attributes is a numeric vector containing the 'employee IDs' which is created using the 'c' command here

```{r str-2, exercise=TRUE}
empId <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

The second attribute is the employee name  which is created using this line of code here which is the character vector 

```{r str-3, exercise=TRUE}
empName <- c("Kamal", "Jamil", "Shobur", "Khan")
```
The third attribute is the number of employees which is a single numeric variable.
```{r str-4, exercise=TRUE}
numberOfEmp <- 4
```

`list()` command: 
We can combine all these three different data types into a list containing the details of employees which can be done using a `list()` command

```{r str-5, exercise=TRUE}
empId <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)                            # employee IDs
empName <- c("Kamal", "Jamil", "Shobur", "Khan")  # employee names
numberOfEmp <- 4                                  # number of the employees

# make a list, combine all these three things:
empList <-  list(empId, empName, numberOfEmp)     # list of the employees

print(empList)
```

* `Type` can be vector as `numeric`, `character` etc 
* `lists` can be made from `types` 
* there are more structures `data.frame`, `matrice`, `arrays` etc 

#### `Data frame` data Structure 

Height and yield value of three varieties under different treatment conditions

Vector as a character:

```{r str-6, exercise=TRUE}
# variety is a character vector
variety<- c("Variety A", "Variety B")

# treatment is a character vector
treatment<-  c("T1", "T2")

# plant height is a numeric vector
height<- c(50, 45, 45, 40, 48, 46)
```

To create data frame use `data.frame()` command
```{r str-7, exercise=TRUE}
# variety is a character vector
variety<- c("Variety A", "Variety B")

# treatment is a character vector
treatment<-  c("T1", "T2")

# plant height is a numeric vector
height<- c(50, 45, 45, 40, 48, 46)

# combine as data frame
data<- data.frame(variety, treatment, height)   # combine all vectors

# print
print(data)
```
Or

alternative way to create a data frame
```{r str-8, exercise=TRUE}
data<- data.frame(variety= c("Variety A", "Variety B"),  
                  treatment=  c("T1", "T2"),
                  height= c(50, 45, 45, 40, 48, 46))
print(data)
```

#### `matrice` data Structure 
```{r str-9, exercise=TRUE}
A <- matrix(
  # Taking sequence of elements
  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), 
  
  # No of rows and columns
  nrow = 3, ncol = 3,  
  
  # By default matrices are 
  # in column-wise order 
  # So this parameter decides
  # how to arrange the matrix          
  byrow = TRUE                             
)

print(A)
```

Or 
```{r str-10, exercise=TRUE}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9),
          nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)

print(A)
```

#### `Arrays` data Structure

```{r str-11, exercise=TRUE}
A <- array(
  # Taking sequence of elements
  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8),
  
  # Creating two rectangular matrices 
  # each with two rows and two columns
  dim = c(2, 2, 2)                        
)

print(A)
```

#### `Factor` data Structure 

Creating factor using factor()
```{r str-12, exercise=TRUE}
fac = factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male",
               "Male", "Female", "Male", "Female"))

print(fac)
```


#### `Tibble` data Structure
```{r str-13, exercise=TRUE}
# you need 'tibble' package to do this job in RStudio
# Create a tibble with three columns: name, age, and city
my_data <- tibble(name = c("Sandeep", "Amit", "Aman"),
                  age = c(25, 30, 35),
                  city = c("Pune", "Jaipur", "Delhi"))

# Print the tibble
print(my_data)
```

### 2. Missing value `NA`
<a href="https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/learnr-for-remote/naniar.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/learnr-for-remote/naniar.jpg" width="500" style="border-radius:8px;">
</a>

#### Let's create a data frame with some `NA` values
```{r tidyr-na-removal-0, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Create 'df' data frame with some NA values
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", NA, "David"),
  age = c(25, NA, 30, 22),
  score = c(90, 85, 88, NA)
  )

# View the original data
print("Original Data:")
print(df)
```
 
```{r tidyr-na-removal-1, exercise=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create 'df' data frame with some NA values
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", NA, "David"),
  age = c(25, NA, 30, 22),
  score = c(90, 85, 88, NA)
  )

# View the original data
print("Original Data:")
print(df)
```

#### Remove `rows` with any `NA` values

```{r tidyr-na-removal-2, exercise=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create 'df' data frame with some NA values
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", NA, "David"),
  age = c(25, NA, 30, 22),
  score = c(90, 85, 88, NA)
)

# Remove rows with any NA values
df_clean <- drop_na(df)

# View the cleaned data
print("Data after removing rows with any NA:")
print(df_clean)
```

#### remove NA only from specific `columns` (e.g., age and score)
```{r tidyr-na-removal-4, exercise=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create 'df' data frame with some NA values
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", NA, "David"),
  age = c(25, NA, 30, 22),
  score = c(90, 85, 88, NA)
)

# remove NA only from specific columns (e.g., age and score) and save as 'df_partial_clean'
df_partial_clean <- df %>%
  drop_na(age, score)

# View the partially cleaned data
print("Data after removing rows with NA in age or score:")
print(df_partial_clean)
```

📝 **Explanation**:

- `drop_na()` removes rows with **any** missing values.
- `drop_na(column1, column2)` removes rows with missing values **only in specified columns**.
- `data.frame()` is used to create a tidy data frame.

### 🧠 **Exercise**: Remove NA only from specific `columns` (e.g., temperature and humidity)
Create a new data frame from the `codes box` bellow and remove `NA` only from specific `columns` (e.g., temperature and humidity)
```
# Create a new data frame
newdf <- data.frame(
 city = c("Stockholm", "Uppsala", "Gothenburg", NA),
 temperature = c(18, NA, 21, 19),
 humidity = c(55, 60, NA, 70)
)
```
💡**Hints**: you may copy 'codes' (see above) and paste here ⤵️ and run the rest as like as the last *explanation* or *codes* 
```{r exercise-rm-na, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise-rm-na-hint}
# Create a new data frame
newdf <- data.frame(
 city = c("Stockholm", "Uppsala", "Gothenburg", NA),
 temperature = c(18, NA, 21, 19),
 humidity = c(55, 60, NA, 70)
)

# remove NA only from specific columns (e.g., temperature and humidity) and save as 'df_partial_clean'
df_partial_clean <- newdf %>%
  drop_na(temperature, humidity)

# View the partially cleaned data
print("Data after removing rows with NA in temperature or humidity:")
print(df_partial_clean)

```


### ✅ Summary:
- Structures: `vector`, `list`, `matrice`, `data.frame`, `arrays`
- `vector` as numeric, character, intiger type etc
- `lists` can be made from vectors
- `Na` can be removed from `rows` 
- Na can be removed from certain `columns`

## Control structures and functions in R [W2 D1]

### Overview

We'll explore control structures (if-else, loops) and functions in R. You'll run code examples and complete exercises to practice these concepts.

#### Control Structures
Control structures help you control the flow of your R programs.

If-Else Statements
If-else statements let you make decisions in your code:

```{r con-str-1, exercise=TRUE}
# Generate a random number between 0 and 10
x <- runif(1, 0, 10)  

if(x > 3) {
  y <- 10
} else {
  y <- 0
}
y
```

#####  📝 Explanation:

runif(1, 0, 10) generates one random number between 0-10

If x > 3, y gets 10

Otherwise, y gets 0

#### **Exercise**

Run the code several times to see different outcomes

Change the condition to x > 5

```{r con-str-1-ex, exercise=TRUE}





```

### For Loops
For loops repeat actions for each element in a sequence:

```{r con-str-2, exercise=TRUE}
# Basic loop printing numbers 1-10
for(i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

you can also remove the curly braces for one line code
```{r con-str-2-1, exercise=TRUE}
for(i in 1:10) print(i)
```

##### 📝 Explanation: 
`i` takes values 1 through 10


```{r con-str-2-2, exercise=TRUE}

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

for(i in 1:4){print(x[i])
  }

for(i in 1:3){print(x[i])
}

```

Loop through a 'character' vector

```{r con-str-3, exercise=TRUE}
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for(fruit in fruits) {
  print(toupper(fruit))
}
```

#####  📝 Explanation:

Processes each element in fruits vector

`toupper()` converts text to uppercase

#### **Exercise**:

Modify the second loop to print fruit names in lowercase (hint: tolower())

Create a loop that prints even numbers between 2-20


```{r con-str-3-ex, exercise=TRUE}





```


### Vectorization vs Loops

R often works better with vectorized operations:

Say, we want to add 1 to every element of a vector:

```{r con-str-4, exercise=TRUE}
# Using a loop
vec <- 1:5

for (i in seq_along(vec)) {
  vec[i] <- vec[i] + 1
}
vec
```

The above can be achieved in R by means of **vectorization**.  
**Vectorization** is an element-wise operation where you perform task/operation on entire vectors/matrices/data.frames.


```{r con-str-4-1, exercise=TRUE}
# Vectorized alternative
vec <- 1:5

vec + 1
```


**Key Insight**:

Vectorized operations are simpler and faster in R

Use loops when you need complex iterative logic

### While Loops
While loops repeat until a condition is met:


```{r con-str-5-1, exercise=TRUE}
count<-0    #The variable count is initialized to 0. This will be our loop counter, starting from 0
while (count<10) {
  print(count)
  count<- count+1
  }
```
📝 **Explanation**:

- A variable named count is created and set to `0`.
- This variable will be used to control how many times the loop runs.
- The loop will continue as long as count is less than `10`.
- Once count reaches `10`, the condition becomes FALSE, and the loop stops.
- `print(count)` displays the current value of count.
- `count <- count + 1` increases the value of count by 1 after each iteration.

Another example:
```{r con-str-5-2, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 1
while (x < 5) {
  cat(x, " ... ")
  x <- x + 1
}
```
explain the above `while loop `to yourselves



'while loop' for more than one condition

```{r con-str-5-3, exercise=TRUE}
z<- 5
set.seed(1)
while(z>=3 && z<=10){
  coin<- rbinom(1,1,0.5)
  if(coin==1){
    z<-z+1
  }else{z<- z-1
  }
}

print(z)
```
Conditions are always evaluated from left to right.
For example, in the above code, if z were less than 3, the second test would not have been evaluated.

Optional
```{r con-str-5-5, exercise=TRUE}
# Count up while condition holds
count <- 0
while(count < 5) {
  print(count)
  count <- count + 1
}

# Simulate a coin flip game
z <- 5
set.seed(123)
while(z >= 3 && z <= 10) {
  coin <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)  # 50% chance of 0 or 1
  if(coin == 1) {
    z <- z + 1
  } else {
    z <- z - 1
  }
}
z
```

📝 **Explanation**:

First loop: Runs while count < 5

Second loop: Simulates a random walk until z exits 3-10 range

rbinom(1,1,0.5) simulates coin flips (1=heads, 0=tails)


**Exercise**:

Change the initial value of z to 6

Modify the coin probability to 0.7 (biased coin)

```{r con-str-5-ex, exercise=TRUE}





```

### Functions
Functions let you package code for reuse.

### Built-in Functions (type 1)

##### example from vector data type
```{r func1, exercise=TRUE}
v <- c(1, 3, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7) # 'v' is a vector here

print(v)                  # Print the contents of vector 'v'
v                         # print the contents of vector 'v'
```


```{r func1-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=9}
v <- c(1, 3, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7) # 'v' is a vector here

mean(v)                   # Calculate the average (mean) of the values in 'v'
median(v)                 # Find the middle value (median) of 'v'
max(v)                    # Get the maximum value in 'v'
min(v)                    # Get the minimum value in 'v'
sum(v)                    # Calculate the total sum of all elements in 'v'
abs(v)                    # Return the absolute values of each element in 'v'
```


```{r func1-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8}
v <- c(1, 3, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7) # 'v' is a vector here

ncol(v)                   # Number of columns (returns NULL for a vector)
nrow(v)                   # Number of rows (returns NULL for a vector)
length(v)                 # Count the number of elements in 'v'
range(v)                  # Return the minimum and maximum values in 'v'

str(v)                    # Display the structure of 'v' (type and length)
```


```{r func1-3, exercise=TRUE}
v <- c(1, 3, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7) # 'v' is a vector here

sort(v, decreasing=TRUE)  # Sort the elements of 'v' in descending order
sort(v, decreasing=FALSE) # Sort the elements of 'v' in ascending order
```

##### example on data frame
demo data:
```{r func2, echo=FALSE}
#make a data frame first
data<-data.frame(variety=c("A", "B", "C"),
                 treatment=c("T1", "T2", "T3"),
                 height=c(50,60, 70, 55, 70,80, 40, 50, 83),
                 yield=c(4,5,6,3.8,6.2,7.3,3.5,4,7))
data
```

make it and execute built-in 'functions' on the data
```{r func3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=26}
#make a data frame first
data <- data.frame(                      # Create a data frame with 4 columns
  variety = c("A", "B", "C"),            # Categorical variable for variety
  treatment = c("T1", "T2", "T3"),       # Categorical variable for treatment
  height = c(50, 60, 70, 55, 70, 80, 40, 50, 83),  # Numeric values for plant height
  yield = c(4, 5, 6, 3.8, 6.2, 7.3, 3.5, 4, 7)     # Numeric values for yield
)

print(data)               # Print the data frame to the console
View(data)                # Open the data frame in a spreadsheet-style viewer (RStudio only)
str(data)                 # Show the structure of the data frame (column types and preview)

mean(data$yield)          # Calculate the mean (average) of the 'yield' column
mean(data$height)         # Calculate the mean of the 'height' column
median(data$height)       # Find the median (middle value) of the 'height' column
max(data$height)          # Get the maximum value in the 'height' column
min(data$height)          # Get the minimum value in the 'height' column
sum(data$height)          # Sum all values in the 'height' column
length(data$height)       # Count the number of elements in the 'height' column
range(data$height)        # Return the minimum and maximum values in 'height'
abs(data$height)          # Return the absolute values of each element in 'height'
str(data$height)          # Show the structure of the 'height' column (numeric vector)

ncol(data)                # Return the number of columns in the data frame
nrow(data)                # Return the number of rows in the data frame

```



### Package 📦 Functions (type 2)
R packages extend functionality. 

But first look at a demo data and its structure:
```{r func4, include=FALSE}
#make a data frame first
data<-data.frame(variety=c("A", "B", "C"),
                 treatment=c("T1", "T2", "T3"),
                 height=c(50,60, 70, 55, 70,80, 40, 50, 83),
                 yield=c(4,5,6,3.8,6.2,7.3,3.5,4,7))
data
```

Structure of the data: 
```{r func5, include=FALSE}
str(data)
```

##### How to use different functions belong to packages in R

Navigation of different functions under `ggplot2` package 📦

```{r func6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20}
data <- data.frame(                      # Create a data frame with 4 columns
  variety = c("A", "B", "C"),            # Categorical variable for variety
  treatment = c("T1", "T2", "T3"),       # Categorical variable for treatment
  height = c(50, 60, 70, 55, 70, 80, 40, 50, 83),  # Numeric values for plant height
  yield = c(4, 5, 6, 3.8, 6.2, 7.3, 3.5, 4, 7)     # Numeric values for yield
)


# Install package (only need once) for data visualization
# install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)                                              # Load the ggplot2 package for data visualization

# Create a boxplot of plant height by variety
ggplot(data, aes(x = variety, y = height, fill = variety)) +  # Initialize the plot with data and aesthetics
  geom_boxplot() +                                            # Add a boxplot layer to show distribution
  labs(title = "Plant Height by Variety",                     # Add a title and axis labels
       x = "Variety", 
       y = "Height (cm)") +
  theme_classic()                                             # Apply a clean, minimal theme to the plot

```


#### User-Defined Functions (type 3)
Create your own functions with `function()`:

```{r func7, exercise=TRUE}
# Calculate circle area
circle_area <- function(r = 1) {
  pi * r^2
}
circle_area(3)  # Radius 3
```


```{r func8, exercise=TRUE}
# Calculate mean of two numbers
mean_two <- function(a, b = 10) {
  (a + b)/2
}
mean_two(5, 15)
mean_two(20)    # Uses default b=10
```


```{r func9, exercise=TRUE}
# Return multiple values
stats <- function(x, y) {
  c(mean = (x+y)/2, 
    sum = x+y)
}
stats(10, 20)
```

##### Key Points:

function() defines new functions

Arguments can have default values (like b = 10)

Use return() or final expression to output results

#### 🧠 **Exercise** `function`

Create a function rectangle_area(length, width) that calculates area

Modify stats() to include product (x*y)

```{r func10, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Reading or importing or loading data
**Examples**:
Importing data from the created files

Import from `csv` file using `readr`package with `read_csv()`
```{r read-1, exercise=TRUE}
sample_data <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:10,
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dave", "Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hank"),
  Age = c(28, 34, 23, 45, 32, 36, 29, 41, 30, 37),
  Score = c(85, 90, 78, 88, 92, 76, 81, 89, 84, 91)
)   # a data frame

# export data in the instance first then read
# export as csv using readr package, with write_csv() function
write_csv(sample_data, "sample_data_readr.csv")

# now read the csv
data_csv_readr <- readr::read_csv("sample_data_readr.csv")
```

Import directly from **URL** with `read_csv()` 
```{r read-2, exercise=TRUE}
students <- read_csv("https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv")
head(students)
```

*Bonus*: If you have 'N/A' not `NA` in the data, how will you consider them as `NA` 
```{r read-3, exercise=TRUE}
studentsNA <- read_csv("https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv", na = c("N/A", ""))

head(studentsNA)
```

Import `.txt` file directly from URL with `read.table()`
```{r import-1, exercise=TRUE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)  # load the data from website (url)
head(Forest)
```

#### Try the following at RStudio

```{r import-2, exercise=TRUE}

## How to look at a data set? [W2 D3]
This chapter is almost a tiny version of the previous chapter named **Exploring and navigating data in R**

### Load Dataset

We need a `data` set to work on. 
We can either use a *built-in data* or upload *our own data* in RStudio environment. 

(You have learned how to upload a data set or `excel/csv/tsv/txt` sheet in R from an earlier class **Write and Read in R**)

Here we attached a built-in `storms` data from `dplyr` package
```{r exp0, exercise=TRUE}
# attach the data
data(storms, package = "dplyr")
```

to see first couple of lines
```{r exp01, exercise=TRUE}
# use of head() function
head(storms)
```

to see last couple of lines
```{r exp02, exercise=TRUE}
# use of tail() function
tail(storms)
```

to know more about the data or function
(it may pop up the results in a new window)
```{r exp03, exercise=TRUE}
# use of `?` or search 
?storms
```

to know structure of the data
(e.g. is data `data.frame` format? 
(e.g. are columns `chr`or `num` or `int` or `factor` ?!)
```{r exp4_1, exercise=TRUE}
# use of str()
str(storms) 
```
we may try `glimpse()` too instead of `str()`

to open entire `storms` data
```{r exp_5, exercise=TRUE}
# use of View()
view(storms)

```

🧠 Extra exercise: You can try `dim()` and `length()` functions too to see how many `variables` and `observations` you have in the dataset


Great! Now you just had quick look around storms data, you just learned how to have a *at glance* look around a data before starting data wrangling or transformation or analysis or future steps


Next chapter ⤵️

## Tidy up data (tidyr) [W3 D3]

Before real exercise let's see an example: 

🧠 Think and reflect yourself on 'what happened when you run the codes in the examples and how? 


💡**Instruction**: Keep all your questions ready if do not understand or have query. And ask when you see an **instructor** during the exercise time.

#### Example `pivot_longer`
Let's make a demo gene 🧬 data (wide_data) by executing the following r 'code block'
```{r tex1_1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6}
wide_data<- data.frame(
  gene=c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3"),
  treatment1=c(2,1,3),
  treatment2=c(2,1,5),
  ct=c(4,1,5))
wide_data
```

let's make it `longer` data format now by using `pivot_longer()` function, by running the following r 'code block', 
then call the `longer_data` to print the data
```{r tex1_2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10}
wide_data<- data.frame(
  gene=c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3"),
  treatment1=c(2,1,3),
  treatment2=c(2,1,5),
  ct=c(4,1,5))

longer_data<- pivot_longer(wide_data,
                           c(treatment1, treatment2, ct),
                           names_to = "condition",
                           values_to = "expression")
longer_data
```

#### `Stoms` data: 
You will do some practice on `storms` data set based on what you have just learned from the previous chapter: **how to look at a data** or lecture and examples. 

Look at the few lines of the storms data set and it's `variables` and `columns` (names to pressure):
```{r tex1.0}
head(storms)
```

#### Exercise 18: Use `pivot_longer` to reshape the dataset

combine 'wind' and 'pressure' columns (variables) and make two new columns 'Measurement' and 'Value'.


```{r tex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10}

```

```{r tex1-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: 
Use pivot_longer() function to combine 'wind' and 'pressure' columns
from storms data. You may use pipe %>% too "
```

```{r tex1-solution}
# use of pivot_longer() function
long_storms <- storms %>%    # pipe %>% ?, see bellow
  pivot_longer(cols = c("wind", "pressure"),
               names_to = "Measurement",
               values_to = "Value")
head(long_storms)
```


🧠 Think and reflect yourselves on what happened when you run the codes and how?

What is [pipe `%>%`](https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/machinelearning-R/pipes-dplyr.html) or `|>` and How pipe `%>%` works? 

#### Example `pivot_wider`
See the following `r_code` and `run` it
```{r tex2_1, exercise=TRUE}
wide_data<- data.frame(gene=c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3"),
                       treatment1=c(2,1,3),
                       treatment2=c(2,1,5),
                       ct=c(4,1,5))

longer_data<- pivot_longer(wide_data,
                           c(treatment1, treatment2, ct),
                           names_to = "condition",
                           values_to = "expression")

head(longer_data) # see few lines

# now turn the 'long_data' into a 'wider_data' 

wider_data<-pivot_wider(longer_data,
                       names_from = condition,
                       values_from = expression)

head(wider_data) # see few lines

```

#### Exercise 19: Use `pivot_wider` to go from long to wide

Do this exercise as like as done **example 2**. But do it on `storms` data set, so do `pivot_longer`  first then `pivot_longer`. see `hints`
```{r tex2, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r tex2-hint-1, hint=TRUE}
"Hint 1: fist use pivot_longer() function to combine 'wind' and 'pressure' columns
from storms data."
```

```{r tex2-hint-2, hint=TRUE}
"Hint 2: then use pivot_wider() to restore original structure using 'Measurement' and 'Value'."
```

```{r tex2-solution}
long_storms <- storms %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("wind", "pressure"),
               names_to = "Measurement",
               values_to = "Value")

# use of pivot_wider() function
wide_storms <- long_storms %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Measurement,
              values_from = Value)
head(wide_storms)
```

🧠 Think and reflect yourselves on what happened when you run the above codes, and how ?

### Example `unite`
```{r exa3_1, exercise=TRUE}
separated_data <- data.frame(
  gene=c("gene1", "gene1", "gene1", 
         "gene2", "gene2", "gene2",
         "gene3", "gene3", "gene3"),
  condition=c("treat1", "treat2", "ct",
              "treat1", "treat2", "ct",
              "treat1", "treat2", "ct"),
  expression=c(2,2,4,
               1,1,1,
               3,5,5)
  )

separated_data


# use of unite() function
united_data<-unite(separated_data, 
                   gene_condition, 
                   c(gene, condition))

united_data
```

#### Exercise 20.1: Use `unite` to combine `status` and `name`
Merge and use a separator `-` or `_` or `,` or tab/space ` `
```{r tex3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r tex3-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: Use unite() to merge two columns with a separator."
```

```{r tex3-solution}
# use of unite() function

united_storms <- storms %>%
  unite("Status_Name", c("status", "name"), sep = "_")

head(united_storms)
```

#### Exercise 20.2 (extra): Use `unite` to combine name and year

```{r tex5, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r tex5-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: You can unite multiple columns like 'name' and 'year'."
```

```{r tex5-solution}
united_name_year <- storms %>%
  unite("Name_Year", c("name", "year"), sep = "_")
head(united_name_year)
```

#### Exercise 20.3 (extra): Combine year, month, day into a date column

Use storm data
```{r tex6, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r tex6-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: Use unite() with three columns and customize the separator."
```

```{r tex6-solution}
storms_with_date <- storms %>%
  unite("date", c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")
head(storms_with_date)
```


🧠 Think and reflect yourselves on what happened when you run the above codes, and how ?

### Example `separate`

```{r exa3_2, exercise=TRUE}
united_data <- data.frame(
  gene_condition = c("gene1_treat1", "gene1_treat2", "gene1_ct",
                   "gene2_treat1", "gene2_treat2", "gene2_ct",
                   "gene3_treat1", "gene3_treat2", "gene3_ct"),
  expression = c(2,2,4,1,1,1,3,5,5)
  )

united_data

# use of separate() function
separated_data <- separate(united_data, 
                           col=gene_condition,
                           into=c("gene", "condition"),
                           sep="_")
separated_data
```

#### Exercise 21: Use `separate` to split the united column

```{r tex4, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r tex4-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: Use separate() to split the combined column back."
```

```{r tex4-solution}
united_storms <- storms %>%
  unite("Status_Name", c("status", "name"), sep = "_")

# use of separate() function
separated_storms <- united_storms %>%
  separate("Status_Name", c("status", "name"), sep = "_")
head(separated_storms)
```

## Data transformation (dplyr) [W3 D1]

data transformation or manipulation with dplyr 

Load the data 'storms' from the dplyr package, have a look on the data (see chapter `How to look at a data set?`) and do the following data manipulation exercises -


### attach the storms dataset
```{r attach, exercise=TRUE}
data(storms, package = "dplyr")

# check or print couple of rows 
head(storms) # head function prints couple of lines in the console
```


```{r attach_view, exercise=TRUE}
# see it as table
View(storms) # view entire data in a separate window or click on the table
```
❗ Check, a separate window poped-up (`base R graphics window`)

```{r attach_search, exercise=TRUE}
# Want to read more without leaving rstudio? then 
?storms
```


```{r attach_dim, exercise=TRUE}
# we can see the types and structure of the data 
## how many rows how many columns?
dim(storms) # 1st place no. rows 2nd place no. of columns
```


```{r attach_class, exercise=TRUE}
# attribute of the object or data
class(storms) # is it a data.frame?
```
is it a data.frame? 
YES

```{r attach_str, exercise=TRUE}
# Compactly Display the Structure of an Arbitrary R Object
str(storms) # it shows you type, rows no. and few values
glimpse(storms) # more nicer view!
```

more nicer view with `glimpse()` but no information about data overall structure

Summarize storms data:
```{r attach_sum, exercise=TRUE}
# results
summary(storms) # give a preview of the data, column wise
```


### Rows transformation
#### Example 
##### filter() 
pick the rows based on their values

filter() lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame.
To use filter(), pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. 
filter() will return every row that passes each logical test.

Extract rows that meet certain condition
try to make data set with only `hurricane`
try to find maximum wind of the hurricane
try to keep only those that have this maximum wind value
one liner command!

```{r row_example1, exercise=TRUE}
only_hurricane <- storms %>% filter(status = "hurricane")
```
❌ **Error!**

Try with double equal sign `==` instead of single `=`
```{r row_example1p1, exercise=TRUE}
only_hurricane <- storms %>% filter(status == "hurricane")

head(only_hurricane)   # to see few lines
```
🚫🔸**Note on Error**: 

* did you notice that we cant use '=' here, because '=' is used to assign something in R (see examples in previous R codes). 
* `==` is used for logical comparison, tests whether two values are equal. 
returns a logical value: TRUE or FALSE. 
* more examples:  >, >=, <, <=, != (not equal), and == (equal).

🔹 Select storms that had maximum wind speed
```{r row_example3, exercise=TRUE}
only_hurricane <- storms %>% filter(status == "hurricane")

max(only_hurricane$wind)
```

summary of each column(variable)
```{r row_example14, exercise=TRUE}
only_hurricane <- storms %>% filter(status == "hurricane")

summary(only_hurricane)
```


```{r row_example15, exercise=TRUE}
2 > 5
```

storms with greater than 120 wind speed
```{r row_example16, exercise=TRUE}
only_hurricane <- storms %>% filter(status == "hurricane")

# 120 wind speed
only_hurricane_wind_120 <- only_hurricane$wind > 120
head(only_hurricane_wind_120)
```

storms with 160 wind speed
```{r row_example17, exercise=TRUE}
only_hurricane <- storms %>% filter(status == "hurricane")

# 160 wind speed
only_hurricane_wind_160 <- only_hurricane %>% filter(wind == 160)
head(only_hurricane_wind_160)
```

storms with 'hurricane' status `and` '160' wind speed
```{r row_example18, exercise=TRUE}
# Multiple tests:
# one liner
storms %>% filter(status == "hurricane") %>% filter(wind == 160) %>% head()
```

Or in short:

```{r row_example10, exercise=TRUE}
# in short
storms %>% filter(status == "hurricane" & wind == 160) %>% head()  # Bolean operator
```
🔸 **examples**: These include `&` (and), pipe `|` (or), `!` (not or negation), and  `xor()` (exactly or).

storms seen during the year '2020'
```{r row_example111, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% filter(year == 2020) %>% head()
```


```{r row_example12, exercise=TRUE}
dim (storms)
```

keep 'NA' values using `is.na`
```{r row_example113, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>%  filter(is.na(tropicalstorm_force_diameter)) %>% dim()
# is.na function keeps all 'NA' values
```
🔸  9512 (out of 19537) rows or (storms or observation) have `NA` value in 'tropicalstorm_force_diameter' column out of 19537

### Exercise 22: Use `filter()` to subset the data set to include only 'hurricane' with wind speed above 100 


```{r trex1, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r trex1-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: Use filter() function, hurricane is present in 'status' column, use '>' operator for  wind speciation"
```


```{r trex1-solution}
strong_hurricanes <- storms %>%
  filter(status == "hurricane", wind > 100) # two conditions: one is hurricane 2nd wind is greater than 100

# Display the subset data set, few lines
head(strong_hurricanes)  
```



### Example Use of arrange() 

changes the ordering of the rows

```{r tr_example2_1, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>%
  arrange(name) %>% head()
```


```{r tr_example2_2, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>%
  arrange(desc(name)) %>% head()
```


```{r tr_example2_3, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>%
  arrange(name, .by_group = T) %>% head()
```


### Exercise 23: Use `arrange()` to sort the data set by descending order of 'year'

```{r tr_ex_2, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r tr_ex_2-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint 1: 
Use the `arrange()` function from the dplyr package.
To sort in descending order, wrap the column name with `desc()`.
Example: arrange(desc(year))"
```


```{r tr_ex_2-solution}
sorted_storms <- storms %>%
  arrange(desc(year))

# Display the sorted data set
head(sorted_storms)
```




### Columns transformation
#### Example
##### select() 

picks variables based on their `column` names.
select one column: 'name'
```{r tr_example3_1, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% select(name) %>% head()
```

select multiple columns: 'name','day','status'
```{r tr_example3_2, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% select(name,day,status) %>% head()
```

select multiple columns by defining the range :'name' to 'wind', 
use `:` sign for range
```{r tr_example3_3, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% select(name:wind)
```

select if column names `start` with a specific `string` (text)
```{r tr_example3_4, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% 
  select(starts_with('tro')) %>% head()

```

select if column names `end` with a specific `string` (text)
```{r tr_example3_5, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% select(ends_with('re'))  %>% head()
```

select if column names `contain` a specific `string` (text)
```{r tr_example3_6, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% select(contains('force')) %>% head()
```


### Exercise 24: Use `select()` to keep only the columns "name", "year", and "wind"

```{r tr_ex_3, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r tr_ex_3-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: Use the `select()` function from the dplyr package.
Provide the column names inside the function like: select(name, year, wind)"
```


```{r tr_ex_3-solution}
storms %>%
  select(name, year, wind)
```

🧑‍🏫 **old way**: if you like to make an `object` first and then display the selected columns 

e.g.:
```
selected_columns <- storms %>%  select(name, year, wind)
``` 
Then call the 'object', 
e.g.:
```
head(selected_columns)
```
🧑‍🏫 **old way**: 
if do not want to use **pipe `(%>%)`** at all 😠,  then you need to bring storms within () bracket. Example: 

```
select(storms, name, year, wind)  # follow this style throughout the tutorials
``` 

### mutate() 
### Example 

adds new variables based on existing variables


Modify an existing column by converting pressure from millibars to atmospheres
`1 atm = 1013.25 millibars`:

```{r tr_example4, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% 
  select (name, year, pressure) %>% 
  mutate(pressure_atm = pressure / 1013.25) %>% head()

```




### Exercise 25: Use `mutate()` to create a new column "wind_squared" based on wind speed (with the square of the wind speed) 

```{r tr_ex_4, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r tr_ex_4-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint:
Use `mutate()` to create new columns.
You can square a variable in R using `^2`, like `wind^2`.
Example: mutate(new_column = existing_column^2)
"
```


```{r tr_ex_4-solution}
storms_mutate <- storms %>%
  mutate(wind_squared = wind^2) # ^2 = square

head(storms_mutate)
```

use of `glimpse()` function instead of `str()`
```{r tr_ex_4_1, exercise=TRUE}
storms_mutate <- storms %>%
  mutate(wind_squared = wind^2) # ^2 = square

# Display the dataset with the new column
glimpse(storms_mutate)
glimpse(storms)
```

**Like it !?** if yes you can use it instead of `str()`

### Exercise 26: Use `mutate()` to create a new column "pressure_category" based on pressure levels

```{r trex5, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r trex5-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint: Use mutate() to create a new column.
Use case_when() to assign different values based on conditions:
Example:
mutate(new_column = case_when(
  condition1 ~ 'label1',
  condition2 ~ 'label2'
))
"
```


```{r trex5-solution}
mutated_storms <- storms %>%
  mutate(
    pressure_category = case_when( # function allows matching and do vectorise
    pressure < 950 ~ "Low", # ~ means assigning new name 
    pressure >= 950 & pressure < 1000 ~ "Medium", # & take two conditions or take range
    pressure >= 1000 ~ "High")
    )

# Display the dataset with the new column
head(mutated_storms)
```


```{r trex51, exercise=TRUE}
glimpse(mutated_storms)
```


### Exercise 27: select name, year and wind. 
Then transform `wind` values from knots to miles per hour (mph).
`1 knot = 1.15 mph`

```{r tr_ex_6, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r tr_ex_6-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint:
First, use `select(name, year, wind)` to keep only those columns.
Then, use `mutate(wind_mph = wind / 1.15)` to convert wind to mph."
```


```{r tr_ex_6-solution}
storms %>% 
  select (name, year, wind) %>% 
  mutate(wind_mph = wind / 1.15) %>% head()
```


### group_by() 
perform any operation “by group”

it comes followed by `summarize()` function

### summarize() 
reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

Lets see an example 

### Example 
```{r tr_example7, exercise=TRUE}
# Group by status and summarize with count of storms
storms %>%
  group_by(status) %>%
  summarize(total_storms = n()) %>% head()
```


```{r tr_example7_1, exercise=TRUE}
# Group by year and summarize with average wind speed
storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% head()
```


### Exercise 28: Use `summarise()` to find the average wind speed and maximum pressure in the dataset

```{r tr_ex_7, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r tr_ex_7-hint, hint=TRUE}
"Hint:
Use `summarise()` to compute:
- `mean(wind)` for average wind (with `na.rm = TRUE`)
- `max(pressure)` for maximum pressure (also use `na.rm = TRUE`)"

```


```{r tr_ex_7-solution}
summary_stats <- storms %>%
  summarise(avg_wind = mean(wind),
            max_pressure = max(pressure, na.rm = TRUE))

# Display the summary statistics
head(summary_stats)
```


### final touch (all commands together)
### Example 
```{r tr_example8, exercise=TRUE}
storms %>% 
  select (name, year, wind) %>% 
  mutate(wind_mph = wind / 1.15) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_wind_mph = mean(wind_mph, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year)) %>% head()
```


### Exercise 29: Use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to find the average wind speed for each status
```{r tr_ex_8, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r tr_ex_8-hint, hint=TRUE}
# Hint:
# - Use `group_by(status)` before using `summarise()`
# - Use `mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE)` inside `summarise()` to handle missing values

```


```{r tr_ex_8-solution}
avg_wind_by_status <- storms %>%
  group_by(status) %>%
  summarise(avg_wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE)) 
# 'na.rm = TRUE' means that missing values will be considered 

# Display the average wind speed for each status
head(avg_wind_by_status)
```


### Merge or joining data 
Let's think there is two data sets: `x` and `y`

❓ How `x` and `y` look like?

##### data `x`
```{r tr_example9_1, echo=FALSE}
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
x
```

##### data `y`
```{r tr_example9_2, echo=FALSE}
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))
y
```
❓ How to do different types of *joining* or *merging*?
#### Example: Inner joining tw0 data sets `x` and `y` by a common `column names`
```{r tr_example9_3, exercise=TRUE}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))

# inner join
inner_join(x,y,by="key")
```


#### Exercise 30: Do inner joining y with x
```{r exercise9, exercise=TRUE}
```


```{r exercise9-hint}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))
#inner join
inner_join(y,x,by="key")

```


#### Example: Left joining two data sets `x` and `y` by a common `column names`
```{r tr_example9_4, exercise=TRUE}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))

# left join

left_join(y,x, by="key")
```


#### Exercise 31: Do left joining y with x
```{r exercise10, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise10-hint}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))
# left join
left_join(y,x,by="key")

```

#### Example: Full joining two data sets `x` and `y` by a common `column names`
```{r tr_example9_5, exercise=TRUE}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))

# full join
full_join(x,y, by="key")
```


#### Exercise 32: Do full joining y with x
```{r exercise11, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise11-hint}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))
# full joining
full_join(y,x,by="key")

```

#### Example: Bind all `columns` of two data sets `x` and `y`, blindly

```{r tr_example9_6, exercise=TRUE}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))


# bind columns
cbind(x,y)
```


#### Exercise 33: Do column bind (`cbind`) y with x
```{r exercise12, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise12-hint}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))


# bind columns
cbind(y, x)
```

#### Example: Bind all `rows` of two data sets `x` and `y`, blindly
```{r tr_example9_7, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}

# x
x <- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y <- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))

# bind rows
rbind(x,y)
```

#### Exercise 34: Do row bind (`r`bind`) y with x
```{r exercise13, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise13-hint}
# x
x<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","3"),
               val_x=c("x1","x2", "x3"))
# y
y<- data.frame(key=c("1","2","4"),
               val_x=c("y1","y2", "y3"))


# bind rows
rbind(y, x)
```

## Data Visualization (ggplot2) [W3 D2]

### Overview
Graphs are essential part of data analysis.


This tutorial introduces basic data visualization 📊 techniques using `ggplot2`.

<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/logo.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/logo.png" width="300" style="border-radius:8px;">
</a>


### Objectives

- Load and explore data
- Create various graph types using `geom_*()` functions
- Use aesthetic mappings (color, size, shape, etc.)
- Customize plots with themes and labels
- Add statistical elements like error bars and significant letters
- Combine and export plots

---

### 🧩 Step 1: Load Packages

```{r install-packages, exercise=TRUE}
# install.packages("ggplot2")  # Un-comment if not installed
# library(tidyverse)  
# library(ggplot2)
```

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Load and Explore the Data
The data must be cleaned up and prepared for plotting. The data must be 'tidy'. Columns must be variables and rows must be observations. The data can then be in wide or long format depending on the variables to be plotted.

We will use the `mpg` data set (built-in, ready to use), which is already in a 'tidy' format.
View few lines of the 'mpg' data:
```{r explore-mpg-2, exercise=TRUE}
head(mpg)
```

View structure of the 'mpg' data:
```{r explore-mpg-1, exercise=TRUE}
str(mpg)
```

If you have your own data make sure it is tidy as we discussed in chapter **Tidy data**

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Create a plot  • `Syntax`

`ggplot2` has a consistent logic and more structured code for plotting. There is bit of a learning curve, but once the code syntax and the logic is clear, it becomes easy to plot a huge variety of graphs.

</a>

#### Basic Scatterplot

#####  Data
Let's write first `ggplot()` function and put the data in there

```{r basic-plot, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg)           # add data
```
You see a gray 'canvas' with nothing is plotted at all!

##### Aesthetics or mapping

Aesthetics are used to assign values to geometries. For example, a set of points can be a fixed size or can be different colors or sizes denoting a variable.

Now  `mapping`, with `aes()` function: 
It will define who (data columns) goes where: who goes to x axis and who goes to y axis

```{r basic-scatterplot-1-1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(
  x = displ,                  # x axis
  y = hwy))                   # y axis
```
You see a gray 'canvas' with x and y axis, but still nothing is plotted at all!


```{r basic-scatterplot-1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(
  x = displ, 
  y = hwy)) +                      # to add next layer or function, we use '+' in ggplot
  geom_point()                     # scatter plot function
```
📊 You see a scatter plot on gray 'canvas' with 'displ' as x as and 'displ' as y axis.  

###### Or

```{r basic-scatterplot-2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy))

```
📊 You see a scatter plot on gray 'canvas' with 'displ' as x axis and 'displ' as y axis.  

###### Get the difference?🤔

`universal` vs `local variable`:

- first plot has aesthetics- (x and y) as `universal` (irespective of plot type) : x and y within ggplot() function, 
- second plot has aesthetics as `local`: x and y within geom_point() function, we will see more examples in the future, then you can trace them, no worries.

---

### 🎨 Aesthetics

#### Aesthetic `mapping`
Add color

```{r color-shape, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy, 
    color = class))               # color aesthetics
```
#### Aesthetic `mapping`
### Scales • `Shape`
add another mpg variable or column with `shape` aesthetics 
```{r color-shape-2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy, 
    color = class, 
    shape = trans))
```

⚠️  By default, you can define only maximum of **6** `shapes`, so *check* your column that goes to `shape` aesthetics. If it there are more than 6 categories in your column, you may try other aesthetic.

#### Aesthetic `parameter`
add custom `shape` , but not in aesthetics 
```{r color-shape-3, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy, 
    color = class), 
    shape = 11)
```
Try different `shape.`
Hints: `3` instead of `11`

### Exercise: aesthetics
**Try to use `size`, and `alpha` as mapping aesthetics in the following r codes. See what they do to the graphs**

```{r aes-exer-1, exercise=TRUE, fig.height=10}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy, 
    color = class, 
    shape = trans))


```


```{r aes-exer-1-hint-1, hint=TRUE, fig.height=10}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy, 
    color = class, 
    shape = trans,
    size= xxx , 
    alpha= xxx ))
```


```{r aes-exer-1-hint-2, hint=TRUE, fig.height=10}
# We choose 2
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy, 
    color = class, 
    shape = trans,
    size= cyl, 
    alpha= cty))
```

---

### 🧩 Faceting for Multiple Plots

-   `Split a plpt to subplots` based on variable(s), 

#### Facets • `facet_wrap`

-   Faceting in `one dimension`: use facet_wrap

```{r faceting-1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 1)
```

📌 **notes**:
`facet_wrap` is used to split a plot into subplots based on the categories in one or more variables.

#### Facets • `facet_grid`

-   Faceting in `two dimensions`
-  try `year` vs `class`

```{r faceting-2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(year ~ class)
```

📌 **notes**: `facet_grid` is also used to split a plot into subplots based on the categories in one or more variables. `facet_grid` can be used to create a matrix-like grid of two variables.

---

### 🧩 Add Smooth Line `geom_smooth()`

```{r smooth-line-1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth()
```
❌ !! ERROR !! 

🐛 **Explanation**: 
it is a issue of `universal and local variables`. We did not define any x or y at `local` level which here `geom_smooth()`, we need to define that if we do not define at `universal` level 


🧯 **Solution**:
just take the mapping part to univesal level
```{r smooth-line-2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```


Or just take the mapping part to next local level, here within `geom_smooth()`
```{r smooth-line-3, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg,) +
  geom_point( mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth( mapping = aes(
    x = displ, 
    y = hwy))
```


which one is easier? use any.


---

### Geometry • `geom_*()`
Geoms are the geometric components of a graph such as points, lines etc used to represent data. The same data can be visually represented in different geoms. For example, points or bars. Mandatory input requirements change depending on geoms.

#### 🧩 Create a Bar Graph `geom_bar()`

We now use the `diamonds` data set.

```{r bar-plot, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(
    x = cut))
```

---

##### 🧩 Sacle • `Fill`
Use Custom Fill Colors by using scale_XXXX_manual() function
```{r bar-custom-fill, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(
    x = cut, 
    fill = cut)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("seagreen", "lightcoral", "blue", "yellowgreen", "black"))
```

---

#### 🧩 Boxplot and Violin Plot `geom_boxplot()`

```{r box-violin, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5)
```

---

#### 🧩 Change Coordinate System `coord_flip()`

```{r flip-coord, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

---

#### 🧩 Polar Coordinates `coord_polar()`

```{r polar-coord, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                         fill = cut), 
           width = 1, 
           show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_polar()
```

---

### 🧩 Enhanced Theming and Titles
Themes allow to modify all non-data related components of the plot. This is the visual appearance of the plot. Examples include the axes line thickness, the background color or font family.


```{r custom-theme, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(
    x = cut, 
    fill = cut)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("seagreen", "lightcoral", "blue", "yellowgreen", "black")) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Diamond Cut Distribution", 
       x = "Cut", 
       y = "Count")
```

---

### 🧩 Save 💾 Your Plot `ggsave()`

```{r save-plot}
ggsave("bargraph1.jpg", width = 8, height = 10, dpi = 400)
```

---

### Advanced plotting

### 🧩 Add Error Bars `geom_errorbar()` and Significant Letters

```{r error-bars, exercise=TRUE}
library(agricolae)  # For agricultural statistics, including LSD.test
library(stats)      # For basic statistical functions like aov()

# Perform one-way ANOVA to test if mean price differs by cut
anova <- aov(price ~ cut, data = diamonds)

# Perform LSD (Least Significant Difference) test for multiple comparisons
LSD_DB <- LSD.test(
  y = diamonds$price,               # Response variable
  trt = diamonds$cut,               # Treatment groups (cut levels)
  DFerror = anova$df.residual,     # Degrees of freedom for residuals from ANOVA
  MSerror = deviance(anova)/anova$df.residual,  # Mean square error from ANOVA
  group = TRUE                      # Return groupings of means
)

# Calculate mean and standard error of price for each cut group
meanSE_DB <- diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%                 # Group data by cut
  summarise(
    avg_DB = mean(price),          # Calculate mean price
    se = sd(price)/sqrt(n())       # Calculate standard error of the mean
  )

# Order LSD group labels alphabetically by cut
ascend_DB <- LSD_DB$groups[order(rownames(LSD_DB$groups)), , drop = FALSE]

# Create a bar plot with error bars and LSD group labels
ggplot(meanSE_DB, aes(x = cut, y = avg_DB, fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black") +  # Bar plot of average prices
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = avg_DB - se, ymax = avg_DB + se), width = 0.2) +  # Error bars
  geom_text(aes(label = ascend_DB$groups), vjust = -0.5) +  # Add LSD group labels above bars
  theme_minimal()  # Use a minimal theme for clean appearance
```

### 💡 Exercise (Optional)

Create a plot comparing `hwy` across `manufacturer` using `geom_violin()` and customize it with `color()` and `themes()`.

```{r challenge, exercise=TRUE}
# Your turn!
```


```{r challenge-hint-1, hint=TRUE}
"Hints: 
Use the ggplot2 package.

ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_violin() is the basic structure.

To flip the axes for better readability, consider coord_flip().

You can customize the color using fill = manufacturer inside aes() or outside for a single color.

Try adding a theme like theme_minimal() or theme_classic() for style."
```


```{r challenge-hint-2, hint=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_violin() +
  theme_minimal() +                 # Clean minimal theme
  labs(title = "Highway MPG by Manufacturer",
       x = "Manufacturer",
       y = "Highway MPG") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")   # Removes redundant legend
```

```{r challenge-hint-3, hint=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_violin() +
  coord_flip() +                    # Flips axes to make manufacturer names readable 
  theme_minimal() +                 # Clean minimal theme
  labs(title = "Highway MPG by Manufacturer",
       x = "Manufacturer",
       y = "Highway MPG") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")   # Removes redundant legend

```

## Statistics in R [W3 D3]

### 📥 Load the Data

```{r load-data-1, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Forest <- read.table('Forest.txt', header = TRUE)
```

Forest data
First few lines of the 'Forest' data:
```{r load-data-3-1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)  # load the data from website (url)
head(Forest)
```

Structure of the 'Forest' data:
```{r load-data-3-2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)
str(Forest)
```

use `head()`  & `str()` to explore its structure.
```{r load-data-3-3, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# HINT: Use `read_table()` to load data from 'Forest.txt' 

Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)
head(Forest)
str(Forest)
```
- Q. Have you noticed anything? 
- A. 'Damage' variable has two groups: '1' and '2' 
We will need these groups in `two samples t-test` in the future


Extract 'Height' variable and view 'Height'. That means: create an object from the variable 'Height' and print
```{r load-data-4, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

Height <- Forest$Height  # create an object from the variable 'Height'

Height                   # print
```


calculate `mean`, `standard deviation` and `length` of the 'Height' variable
```{r one-sample-ttest-2, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

Height <- Forest$Height # create an object from the variable 'Height'

mean(Height)   # calculate average or mean 
sd (Height)    # calculate Standard deviation (sd)
length(Height) # calculate length of the data 
```

### 📊 One Sample t-test

perform a `one sample t-test` to compare the mean Height with constant 6

```{r one-sample-ttest-1, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

# create an object from the variable 'Height'
Height <- Forest$Height

# Use t.test() with mu = 6 to compare against the constant 6.

t.test(Height, mu = 6) 

# or
# t.test(Height, mu = 6, alternative = "two.sided")
```

### 🔍 Two Samples t-test (Height by Damage class)

Do the `two samples t-test`

```{r two-sample-ttest-1, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

# create an object from the variable 'Height'
Height <- Forest$Height

# create an object from the variable 'Damage'
Damage <- Forest$Damage
cat("Damage variable has two groups in it, either '1' or '2':\n", Damage) # 'cat' prints the texts and '\n' give a break and print rest in a new line

# Subset Height based on Damage groups
Height1 <- Height[Damage == 1] # group 1
Height2 <- Height[Damage == 2] # group 2

# Welch t-test
t.test(Height1, Height2) # t.test

```

perform a t-test by '*homogeneous variance*'
```{r two-sample-ttest-3, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

# create an object from the variable 'Height'
Height <- Forest$Height

# create an object from the variable 'Height'
Damage <- Forest$Damage
Damage

# Subset Height based on Damage groups
Height1 <- Height[Damage == 1] # Damage group 1
Height2 <- Height[Damage == 2] # Damage group 2

# Student t-test (equal variance)
t.test(Height1, Height2, var.equal = TRUE)
```

### 🍒 Paired t-test with Cherry Dataset

* Upload the data

* create an object with cherry yield from the 1st year

* create an object with cherry yield from the 2st year

* perform a paired t-test to compare the mean yields from two years  

```{r paired-ttest, exercise=TRUE}
# upload cherry data
# Cherry <- read.table('Cherry.txt', header = TRUE)
Cherry <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Cherry.txt"), header = TRUE)

# year objects
Year1 <- Cherry$Year1
cat ("Year1: ", Year1) # 'cat' prints texts and object

Year2 <- Cherry$Year2
cat ("Year2: ", Year2)


# paired t test
t.test(Year1, Year2, paired = TRUE)
```


```{r paired-ttest-dif, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# upload cherry data
Cherry <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Cherry.txt"), header = TRUE)

# year objects
Year1 <- Cherry$Year1
Year2 <- Cherry$Year2

Diff <- Year1 - Year2
mean(Diff)
sd(Diff)
```

### 🍒 Two Sample t-test 
Use Cherry data set (Cherry yields) 

* create objects: Year1 and Year2 

* perform t-test assuming the variance is equal 

```{r cherry-two-sample-ttest, exercise=TRUE}
# HINT: This is an unpaired t-test with var.equal = TRUE.
Cherry <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Cherry.txt"), header = TRUE)
Year1 <- Cherry$Year1
Year2 <- Cherry$Year2

t.test(Year1, Year2, var.equal = TRUE)
```

### 📈 One-Way ANOVA
use 'Volume' data set & perform ANOVA:

* create an object 'Phos'from the variable'PHOS', 
*PHOS means Phosphorous (Chemical compound)*

* change the 'data type': convert the object 'Phos' to factor 

* create a new object 'mod.1' with results of ANOVA and display its content

```{r anova-oneway, exercise=TRUE}
# HINT: Convert PHOS to a factor and use aov() for ANOVA.
# Volume <- read.table('Volume.txt', header = TRUE)
Volume <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Volume.txt"), header = TRUE)

str(Volume)

# change the data type to factor
Phos <- as.factor(Volume$PHOS) # factorization
cat ("Phos: ", Phos) # PHOS or Phos is another grouping

# create a new object 'Vol' from the variable 'VOL'
Vol <- Volume$VOL
cat ("Vol: ", Vol) # 'cat' prints

# perform ANOVA 
# create a new object 'mod.1' with results of ANOVA
mod.1 <- aov(Vol ~ Phos) # aov perform ANOVA 

# and display its content
summary(mod.1) # display the analysis
```

### 🔗 Correlation Analysis
Make correlation between 'DBH' and 'Height' variables or columns 

* use Forest data set and create objects
* calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient 
* do significance test of the correlation coefficient 


```{r correlation, exercise=TRUE}
# HINT: Use cor() and cor.test() to analyze correlation.
# Forest <- read.table('Forest.txt', header = TRUE)
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

DBH <- Forest$DBH
cat ("DBH: \n", DBH) # to see what values they are in 'DBH'


Height <- Forest$Height
Height
cat ("Height: \n", Height) # to see what values they are in 'Height'

# Pearson correlation between DBH and Height
cor(DBH, Height)

# Significance test of the corellation coefficient
cor.test(DBH, Height)
```

### 📉 Simple Linear Regression
Fit a linear regression model to the data and display the summary of the results

```{r regression, exercise=TRUE}
# HINT: Use lm() to fit the model and abline() to add regression line.
# Forest <- read.table('Forest.txt', header = TRUE)
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

DBH <- Forest$DBH

Height <- Forest$Height

# apply linear model (lm)
myfit <- lm(Height ~ DBH) 

# summary of the model
summary(myfit)

# quick plot
plot(DBH, Height, pch = 16, col = 'blue') # scatter plot
abline(myfit, col = 'red') # Add Straight Lines to a Plot
legend(x = 14, y = 5, legend = "observations", pch = 16, col = 'blue') # put a legend
```

### 🔁 Regression DBH on Height
Fit a linear regression model to the data and display the summary of the results  
* change of variables: Regression DBH on Height
 
* DBH becomes dependent, Height becomes independent
 
* test the opposite too. Height becomes dependent, DBH becomes independent

```{r regression-reverse, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

DBH <- Forest$DBH
Height <- Forest$Height

# HINT: Swap dependent and independent variables.
myfit.1 <- lm(DBH ~ Height, data = Forest)
summary(myfit.1)

# test the opposite 'Height ~ DBH'

```


### 📊 ANOVA for Linear Regression

Test for Significance of a Linear Regression with ANOVA 

* create objects with variables 
* fit Linear Regression model `lm` 
* do ANOVA

```{r anova-regression, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Forest <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abu85/datasets/refs/heads/main/Forest.txt"), header = TRUE)

DBH <- Forest$DBH
Height <- Forest$Height

# HINT: Use anova() to test the linear regression.
myfit <- lm(Height ~ DBH, data = Forest)

# ANOVA
anova(myfit)
```
You've practiced multiple statistical tests using real data sets.
